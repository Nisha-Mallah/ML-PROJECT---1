 • About project
 • Objective: Detect network intrusions using machine learning.
 • Data Handling: Preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, and checking for missing values and
 duplicates.
 • Model Training: Train multiple models (decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting).
 • Optimization: Hyperparameter tuning with optuna|.
 • Outcome: Best model saved for deployment
